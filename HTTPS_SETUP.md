# HTTPS Setup Instructions for devlpr.me

## IMPORTANT: Contact Your Hosting Provider

To fix the "Not secure" warning, you need to ask your hosting provider (devlpr.me) to:

### 1. Enable SSL Certificate
- Request SSL/TLS certificate installation for your domain
- Most hosting providers offer free Let's Encrypt certificates
- Or they may provide their own SSL certificates

### 2. Force HTTPS Redirect at Server Level
Ask them to add these server configurations:

**For Apache (.htaccess - already included in your files):**
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

**For Nginx:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name devlpr.me;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

### 3. Update DNS Settings (if needed)
- Ensure A records point to HTTPS-enabled server
- Add CNAME record if using CDN

### 4. Test HTTPS
After setup, test:
- https://devlpr.me/kcs-consultancy-website/
- Check for green padlock icon
- Verify no mixed content warnings
